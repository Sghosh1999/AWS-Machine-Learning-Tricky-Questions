**Question 1:**

1. You are creating a classification model using one of the Amazon SageMaker built-in algorithms and you want to use GPUs for both training and inference.

Which of the following steps would you follow to meet this requirement? (Select two)

Correct Options:
- [x] Select a built-in algorithm that supports GPUs for both training and inference
- [x] Select the correct instance type that supports GPUs

**Question 2:**
A healthcare company runs machine learning (ML) models on sensitive health data for its customers and the company is concerned about data security. The company is looking out for a solution to protect the data at rest as well as in-transit while running the Machine Learning specific processes on this data. The company uses Amazon SageMaker as its primary data science environment.

As an AWS Certified Machine Learning Specialist, which of the following options would you combine to address the given use case? (Select three.)

- [x] Use AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) to manage encryption keys for encrypting data at rest and use TLS for encrypting data in transit.

- [x] Enable network isolation for training jobs and models
- [x] Connect to the SageMaker API or to the SageMaker Runtime through an interface endpoint in your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

**Question 3**
Which of the following SageMaker algorithms can be used both as a built-in-algorithm as well as a framework to run your own customized scripts?

- [x] XGBoost
